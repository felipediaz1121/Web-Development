        <h3>- What is Sigma Lambda Beta? -</h3>
    
    <div class="line">

    </div>
    <p class="paragraph">Sigma Lambda Beta was founded on April 4th, 1986 
        at the University of Iowa. It is based on
         cultural understanding and wisdom. Most noteworthy 
         is that 18 men of whom 15 were of Latin American or 
         Hispanic origin/decent who founded Sigma Lambda Beta.</p>
    
     <p class="paragraph2">We believe in the principles of fairness, opportunity,
          and in the equality of all men no matter what their
           race, culture, or ethnicity. Our biggest goal is to
            see that all of society can realize the importance 
            of these three principles. In order to achieve this
             goal we all strive to model these behaviors and 
             present ourselves in a gentlemanly and educated 
             fashion. Within only four years of its inception, 
             SLB had already expanded to all four geographic 
             corners of the United States, and even Puerto Rico.
              Not only is it the fastest growing Latino-Based 
              Fraternity, but it is also the largest. Although
               we are Latino-Based, we stress multicultural 
               membership and have the highest diversity in our
                membership, with over 120 different nationalities 
                represented.

        <div class="brotherhood">
            <h1>Brotherhood</h1>
            
            <p class="explanation">Brothers of Sigma Lambda Beta pride themselves 
                in creating a family-oriented atmosphere at the 
                campuses we are present at. This support network
                 is one of the key aspects that makes our 
                 organization so powerful. As the largest
                  latino-based fraternity, the networking gained 
                  through joining out organization is amazing.
                   Our alumni work in a multitude of fields form
                    education to engineering to law.</p>
            <p class="explanation">
                Even more important than career networking is the genuine
                 brotherhood that we share. We are more than just an
                  organization. WE ARE FAMILY. You will never hear a
                   brother of Sigma Lambda Beta referring to another
                    member as their "fraternity brother". We are 
                    "Brothers" and carry ourselves as such. 
            </p>

            <h1>Scholarship</h1>
            
            <p class="explanation">Since its inception, Sigma Lambda Beta recognized
                 the key to building a strong brotherhood was 
                 premised on the academic welfare of its members.
                  In order to live by the fraternity's four principles, 
                  it was imperative that the members continued to stress 
                  the importance of academic achievement. Most than two 
                  decades later, the same emphasis on education is still 
                  present within the organization. </p>
            <p class="explanation">
                One of the main objectives of Sigma Lambda Beta is helping 
                its members graduate from college. The development of social 
                and service skills help nurture members into men with strong
                 leadership qualities. Within this domain is the potential 
                 to become a prominent figure in his chosen career and
                 community. The opportunity for a college education is one 
                 of the many experiences that help mold our members into the
                  leaders they are today.
            </p>
        
        </div>
        
        <div class="cultural-awareness">
            <h1>Cultural Awarness</h1>
            
            <p class="explanation">This is such a prominent principle and is what separates us 
                from other fraternities. Emphasis is placed on making
                 cultural awareness present on campus. Some of the more 
                 popular events carried out by brothers on a national level 
                 are: El Dia De Los Muertos, Cinco De Mayo, and the Puerto 
                 RicanDay Parade to name a few.</p>
            <p class="explanation"> 
                It is important to note that culture is not equivalent to
                 race or ethnicity. College life is a culture. So is
                  married life. Hip-hop fans share a culture as do die-hard
                   NFL fans. No one belongs to only one culture. We pull 
                   our lifestyle from various cultures, and it is our belief
                   at a true understanding of these many cultures will raise
                    our tolerance for each other's differences, hence united 
                    society and making the world a better place to live in.

        <div class="community-service">
            <h1>Community Service</h1>
       
            <p class="explanation">With community service being one of the principles in which
                 the Fraternity was founded upon, involvement within the
                  community is one aspect that Sigma Lambda Beta takes 
                  great pride in. Since 1986, brothers have made a
                  difference in their respective regions.</p>
            <p class="explanation">
                Each affiliation of the fraternity concentrates on different 
                programs based on location. Many of these range from 
                tutoring and motivational speaking to planting trees and 
                building houses for low-income families.
 
            </p>
            <p class="explanation">
                One of our national philanthropies is The Victor Correa 
                CPR Awareness Day, in which chapters all over the country
                 certify hundreds of people in CPR. This is in honor of our
                  fallen Brother Victor Correa, who could have been saved 
                  if someone had known CPR at the beach where he was taken 
                  from us.
